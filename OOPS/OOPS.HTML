        pillars of OOPS
        UNDERSTANDING OOPS BY REAL TERMS
        1.OBJECT
        2.CLASS
        3.INHERITENCE
         1.OBJECT->evrything is object 
         human,car 
          object has 2 things>>>>
         a.featyres or property
         b. behaviours.action performed by or on it.
        EXAMPLE>>>
        rahul is object 
        >>full name ,age,weight,color,height(a)
        >> eat,walk,sleep,run (b)
        so for DRY concept>>>class introduced
        it takes the common property of object and present as blueprint.
        CLASS means grouping of object. 
        diff object may have diff behaviours so to eliminate this INHERITANCE was introduced
        procedural vs object
        in OOP concept we grop function and variable in a block called class

        4 PILLARS of oops
        A.Encapsulation: >>wrapping updata and member function together into a single unit i.e class.
        B. Abstraction >> showing only necessory features of an object to the outside world
        like on tv with remote and see the channel but inside what happning we dnt know
        C. inheritence >> take the property between child element from the parent element.
        D. polymorphism >>> many forms a subclass can define its own unique behaviour and still share the same 
        functionalities or bhevaiours of its parent base class.
